based on this: https://github.com/cipz/k3s-kubernetes-flask-hello-world
docker build -t test1 .
docker save k3s-kubernetes-flask-hello-world | k3s ctr images import -
k3s ctr images ls

kc apply -f dep.yaml

kc get all => read the loadbalancer ip
then connect to vps using tunnel to this ip

but the problem is that I can't connect to Flask app from outside. That's why I am looking for a solution
